		<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

			This the other main goal of this site:
			experimenting with a self-documenting content structure:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide a sourcecode link structure for each functionality of the <a href="/sample-webapp">sample web app</a>, just in place on the user interface.</li>
			<li>For each functionality, arrange the sourcode link structure according to a call tree, maybe refined to represent the logics and architecture.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Look at the top of this very page!
			The gray horizontal menubar with the colorful buttons belongs to the business logic and functionality of the sample web app.
		</p>
		<p>
			But now we are more interested in the graph-like figure above the horizontal menu bar.
